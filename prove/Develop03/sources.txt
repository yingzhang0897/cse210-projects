(Alma 34:17) Therefore may God grant unto you, my brethren,that ye may begin to exercise your faith unto repentance,  that ye begin to call upon his holy name,that he would have mercy upon you;
(Alma 34:18) Yea, cry unto him for mercy;for he is mighty to save.
(Alma 34:19) Yea, humble yourselves, and continue in prayer unto him.
(Alma 34:22-23)  Yea, cry unto him against the power of your enemies. Yea, cry unto him against the devil, who is an enemy to all righteousness.
